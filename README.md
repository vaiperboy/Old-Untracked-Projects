**This will be the only README for all the projects.** The projects uploaded here work (or at least used to). But again, since I am mass uploading them some of the projects might not adhere to some rules nor principles as some of the projects are a few years old and I was just getting started with programming.


# My previously done projects

This repository contains some of the worthy mentioning projects that I have done in the past that were never tracked nor uploaded on Github (due to my stupidity). For this reason, excuse the lack of documentation and comments for the source files.

All of these projects were fully developed by me for my own personal use and I have used them in some time period (I am a guy who likes crafting his own tools rather than using others' tools)

---  

I made the list below to make my life and yours easier. It contains the projects and the links to the matching folder of each project.
The columns are as below:
- Project Name
- Project duration (when it was created and how long the development/usage lasted)
- Language(s) & technologies used in the project
- Scope of the project (either `small`, `medium` or `big`)

The projects are sorted in descending order, **having the most interesting/complicated project at the top, and the least interesting ones at the bottom of the list.**
| Project Name | Project duration | Lang & Tech used | Scope | Description |
| ------------ | ---------------- |----------------- | :---: | ----------- |
| [Account Creator](Blizzard%20Account%20Creator/) | _26/5/2020 till 16/8/2021_ | `C#` **(.NETCore, Async, Selenium, Multithreaded, API, Logging)** | `big` | This project mass create accounts for a website & phone verify them. It uses `Selenium` for browser emulation (with my own modified driver), plenty of API requests for certain providers and a hefty amount of proper multithreading everywhere
| [Discord Bot](COD_Discord_Bot/) | _26/5/2020 till 16/8/2021_ | `C#` **(.NETCore, Async, Multithreaded, API, IMAP, Logging)** | `medium` | This project is a complementary with the [Account Creator](Blizzard%20Account%20Creator/). It comes in the form of a Discord bot to call in plenty of commands with full authorization and authentication process for different roles and users
| [IKout In-Game Assister](ikout_assister/) | _11/1/2020 till 11/3/2020_ | `C#` **(.NET, Async, [EmguCV](https://github.com/emgucv/emgucv))** | `medium` | This was made for fun personal use where the tool would help me to capture the cards that were previously thrown on the screen from a game called 'iKout' using [EmguCV](https://github.com/emgucv/emgucv) (an OpenCV wrapper for .NET) and develop a strategy for me to win. The game is ran on the machine via any android emulator (however this project was made for Noxplayer)
| [Quote Displayer](QuoteDisplayer/) | _16/8/2022_ | `NodeJS` **(ReactJS, ExpressJS)** | `small` | Only a small project to display quotes on a nicely formatted website that I have it communicate with the backend API
| [Fun Discord Bots](Discord%20Bots/) | _1/7/2019 till 28/12/2019_ | `C#` **(.NETCore, Async, Multithreading, APIs)** | `medium` | A console application that abuses the 'reward' system on few discord bots by preforming multiple API requests & with session feature
| [Subnetter](Subnetter/) | _24/4/2020 till 30/4/2020_ | `C#` **(.NET, Forms)** | `small` | This project was made to help with my studies in a certain course in my university. It helped me with finding the list of hosts, broadcasts and other fields by only providing an IP address and a subnet mask. It does bitwise operations and few other things.

As many other developers out there, there are many more softwares that I ~~cannot find~~ have developed that but poorely written and find no need to post them here.
