This will be the only README for all the projects. The projects uploaded here work (or at least used to). But again, since I am mass uploading them some of the projects might not adhere to some rules nor principles as some of the projects are a few years old and I was just getting started with programming.


# My previously done projects

This repository contains some of the worthy mentioning projects that I have done in the past that were never tracked nor uploaded on Github (due to my stupidity). For this reason, excuse the lack of documentation and comments for the source files.

All of these projects were fully developed by me for my own personal use and I have used them in some time period (I am a guy who likes crafting his own tools rather than using others' tools)

## My Projects

I made the list below to make my life and yours easier. It contains the projects and the links to the matching folder of each project.
The columns are as below:
- Project Name
- Project duration (when it was created and how long the development/usage lasted)
- Language(s) & technologies used in the project
- Scope of the project (either `small`, `medium` or `big`)

The projects are sorted in descending order, **having the most interesting/complicated project at the top, and the least interesting ones at the bottom of the list.**
| Project Name | Project duration | Lang & Tech used | Scope | Description |
| ------------ | ---------------- |----------------- | :---: | ----------- |
| [Account Creator](Blizzard%20Account%20Creator/) | _26/5/2020 till 16/8/2021_ | `C#` **(.NETCore, Async, Selenium, Multithreaded, API, Logging)** | `big` | This project mass create accounts for a website & phone verify them. It uses `Selenium` for browser emulation (with my own modified driver), plenty of API requests for certain providers and a hefty amount of proper multithreading everywhere.
| [Discord Bot](COD_Discord_Bot/) | _26/5/2020 till 16/8/2021_ | `C#` **(.NETCore, Async, Multithreaded, API, IMAP, Logging)** | `big` | This project is a complementary with the [Account Creator](Blizzard%20Account%20Creator/). It comes in the form of a Discord bot to call in plenty of commands with full authorization and authentication process for different roles and users.
